# Overview
The out of the box file upload component has 2 limitations on mobile devices:
1. Not all mobile devices allow photos to be captured directly by the camera
2. When an upload fails, there is no way to retry the upload, instead a new photo needs to be taken for upload

This mobile file upload component allows a file to be uploaded by directly capturing an image with the camera on the phone.

The file input HTML element allows for this situation by providing a capture attribute.
With this attribute set to `environment`, the browser will automatically open the forward facing camera,
while a value of `user` allows for the back camera to be opened for selfies.

See the [capture and accept](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/file#capture) attributes at mdn.

On mobile devices the upload proces can fail for any number of reasons.
Since these files are directly captured by the camera, it is not always easy for the user to retake a photo.
Therefore this component allows for retrying a failed upload attempt without the user needing to re-take the photo.

## Note
- On desktop browsers the capture attribute will be ignored, and instead a file selector menu will be shown as fallback.
- For an out of the box file upload component, the option to select a photo using the camera disappears when the accept attribute is set.

The `accept` attribute can be used to determine what [type of media](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/file#unique_file_type_specifiers) can be selected:
- use `image/*` to open the camera for taking photo's
- use `video/*` to open the camera for taking a video
- use `audio/*` to open a voice recorded for recording audio
