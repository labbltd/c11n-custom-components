# Overview
When a Pega application is used in an environment where internet is unreliable, it is important to give early feedback to the user about the network status.

When the `restoredDuration` is configured, the network status component will not display anything.
Set `restoredDuration` to `0` to always show the banner.

This component monitors the online status of the browser, and will show a warning banner when the browser goes offline.
When the internet is restored, the banner will notify the user and after a timout disappear again.

Toggle the WiFi connection to see the component in the demo below.
